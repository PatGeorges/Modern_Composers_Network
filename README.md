# Modern_Composers_Network
 A network of 20th century composers
 
 In this notebook (Modern_composers.ipynb) and the attached python script (Modern_composers.py) we share the code that permits to generate Figures 5, 7 and 8 of Georges and Seckin (2022) (reference below). 
 
 The fa2/ForceAtlas2 Python library is not compatible with Python 3.9. Therefore, in the notebook Modern_composers.ipynb, we show how to revert to Python 3.8 in Google Colab.  We then simply run a script (Modern_composers.py) from within Google Colab.  Three datasets (.csv files) are needed: Adjacency_ matrix_modern_composers.csv, Nodelist_modern_composers.csv, and Labels_column_modern_composers.csv
